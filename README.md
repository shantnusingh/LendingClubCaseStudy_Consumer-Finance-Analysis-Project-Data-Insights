# Lending Club Case Study

## Problem Statement

You are working for a consumer finance company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When a loan application is received, the company must decide whether to approve the loan based on the applicantâ€™s profile. There are two types of risks associated with the bank's decision:

1. **Business Loss**: If the applicant is likely to repay the loan but is denied, the company loses potential business.
2. **Financial Loss**: If the applicant is unlikely to repay the loan (i.e., likely to default), approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

## Objective

The objective of this study is to utilize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the likelihood of default.

## Constraints

When a person applies for a loan, the company can make one of two decisions:

1. **Loan Accepted**: If the company approves the loan, there are three possible scenarios:
   - **Fully Paid**: The applicant has fully repaid the loan, including both the principal and interest.
   - **Current**: The applicant is in the process of repaying the loan installments; the tenure of the loan has not yet been completed. These applicants are not labeled as 'defaulted.'
   - **Charged-Off**: The applicant has failed to make payments on time for an extended period, indicating that they have defaulted on the loan.

2. **Loan Rejected**: The company rejects the loan if the applicant does not meet the required criteria. Since no loan was granted, there is no transactional history for these applicants in the dataset.
